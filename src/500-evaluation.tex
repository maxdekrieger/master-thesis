\chapter{\label{chap:evaluation}Evaluation}

In this chapter we will evaluate the results of the work done in this thesis. First we will assess the correctness of the modernized WebDSL front-end by defining what correctness means in absence of a formal specification and evaluating accordingly. Next, we will share, inspect and reason about the performance of the new parser and static analyses. Lastly, we conclude this chapter by discussing the usability of the modernized implementation in practice.

\section{\label{sec:correctness}Correctness}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Defining correctness in absence of a formal specification
    \item How correct is the implementation WebDSL
    \item Explain correctness
    \item Edge cases
  \end{itemize}

  SDF3:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Expect same in WebDSL's arsing test suite
    \item Parse analysis test suite files with SDF2 and SDF3 specification, expect to fail/ambiguous on the exact same files
    \item Parse YellowGrass and Codefinder, expect to fail/ambiguous on the exact same files
    \item (Compare ASTs by hand)
    \item Explain differences
  \end{itemize}

  Statix:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analysis test suite: expect to pass all
    \item Analyze YellowGrass and Codefinder, expect 0 errors
    \item Explain differences
  \end{itemize}

\section{\label{sec:performance}Performance}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Explain metrics and methods
    \item Results
    \item Discuss results
  \end{itemize}

  SDF3:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Parse analysis test suite files with both SDF2 and SDF3, show difference in timings
    \item Parse YellowGrass and Codefinder with both SDF2 and SDF3, show difference in timings
  \end{itemize}

  Statix:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analyze analysis test suite files with both Stratego and Statix analysis, show difference in timings
    \item Analyze YellowGrass and Codefinder with both Stratego and Statix analysis, show difference in timings
  \end{itemize}

\section{\label{sec:usability}Usability}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of user-friendliness of the error messages generated by Statix
    \item Can the WebDSL Statix specification be used as formal specification?
    \item Maintainability of the Statix and SDF3 codebase
  \end{itemize}
