WebDSL is a domain-specific language for web programming that is being used for over ten years. As web applications evolved over the past decade, so did WebDSL. A complete formal specification of WebDSL has been *TO-DO: check if missing or not updated* since its original development. With the introduction of Statix in the Spoofax Language Workbench, a declarative language that generates a typechecker, we made an elegant and practical formal semantics for WebDSL.
