    \item Static consistency checking of web applications with WebDSL (Hemel, Groenewegen, Kats, Visser). JSC 2011.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Importance of early feedback to developer.
      \item Different inconsistencies that can be checked and how they are often checked.
      \item Importance of linguistic integration to enable consistency checking at compile time.
      \item How WebDSL is designed to enable early reporting of inconsistencies.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Introduces the Links programming language.
      \item Links generates all tiers of web application: client-side HTML and JavaScript, server-side OCaml and SQL for the database.
      \item Links tackles the impedance mismatch problem of different input/output provided and expected by the different tiers.
      \item Links is a strict, typed, functional language with all state saved in the client-side.
    \end{itemize}

      \item Similar to Links, Ur/Web is a functional programming language that generates code for all tiers of a web application.
      \item Ur/Web introduces encapsulation and simple concurrency.
      \item Encapsulation: treating key pieces of web applications as private state (?).
